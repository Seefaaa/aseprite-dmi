# DMI Editor for Aseprite

This project is a DMI (BYOND's Dream Maker icon files) editor extension for Aseprite, a popular pixel art tool. It is built with Rust and Lua, and is designed to enhance the Aseprite experience by providing tools for editing and managing DMI files.

## Download

You can download the ready-to-use version of this extension from the [Releases](https://github.com/Seefaaa/aseprite-dmi/releases) page on the project's GitHub repository.

After downloading or building the project, you can add the extension to Aseprite by dragging and dropping it into Aseprite or by using `Add Extension` button in `Edit > Preferences > Extensions`.

You can now open DMI files in Aseprite just like other file formats.

## Trustworthiness

This project is open source, which means that the source code is freely available for anyone to review and contribute to. This transparency allows the community to verify that the project does not contain any malicious code.

Additionally, the project's releases are built using a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, which ensures that the code is automatically compiled and tested before being released. This further reduces the risk of introducing any harmful code.

It's important to note that any antivirus warnings or false positives should be taken with caution. Sometimes, antivirus software may flag legitimate software as potentially harmful due to various reasons, such as unfamiliar code patterns or behavior. If you encounter any antivirus warnings, you can safely ignore them and trust the project's open source nature and CI pipeline for its reliability and security.
